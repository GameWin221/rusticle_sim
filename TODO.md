# To Do:

1. Rendering:
    - Bloom https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Phys.-Based-Bloom
    - Particles change their appearance (radius / color / brightness) based on their activity (neighbor count or velocity)

2. UI
    - Ready presets for color table and other settings

3. Make code more readable and clean

# Problems:
### MULTITHREADING DOESN'T GIVE AS MUCH BENEFITS AS IT SHOULD - MAYBE USE A THREADPOOL? - MAYBE ITS LOCKING THE PARTICLES VECTOR?
