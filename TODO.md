# To Do:

1. Rendering:
    - Bloom https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Phys.-Based-Bloom
    - Particles change their radius / color / brightness based on their neighbor count or velocity

2. UI
    - Control buttons
    - Saving and loading
    - Better color table and adding colors
    - Selecting ready presets etc.

3. Regenerate the simulation on loading

# Problems:
### MULTITHREADING DOESN'T GIVE AS MUCH BENEFITS AS IT SHOULD - USE A THREADPOOL
