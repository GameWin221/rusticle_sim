# To Do:

1. Rendering:
    - Bloom https://learnopengl.com/Guest-Articles/2022/Phys.-Based-Bloom
    - Particles change their radius / color / brightness based on their neighbor count or velocity

2. UI
    - Better organised UI
    - Saving and loading
    - Better color table and adding colors
    - Selecting ready presets etc.

3. Saving and loading
    - Color table
    - Particle settings
    - World size

# Ideas:
### Maybe seed for randomness?

# Bugs and errors:
### UI WRAP MODE CANT BE CHANGED BECAUSE UI IS UPDATED FOR A TOO SHORT PEROID OF TIME (Maybe enable vSync Back)
### MULTITHREADING DOESN'T GIVE AS MUCH BENEFITS AS IT SHOULD - USE A THREADPOOL
